Beautiful text chat for your community.

New chat systems have been appearing for the past 20 years, but they are all built for one-to-one or private conversations in small groups.

Open communities, on the other hand, are larger and public by default. These communities form around open source projects, consumer brands, sports teams, entertainment franchises and many more. They need different tools.
IRC is one – it is the great grand-daddy of social text chat – but it predates the web and most users find it hopelessly complex and archaic.

Scrollback is a modern, beautifully designed platform for open communities to converse. It combines the lessons learned from IRC with the ease-of-use of an embeddable web app and the power of a cloud hosted service.
